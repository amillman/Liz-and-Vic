            <div>justine had a widowed mom</div>
            <div>but she was really mean to her</div>
            <div>even though her dad loved her</div>
            <div>her mom had some weird grudge</div>
        </div>

        <div class="vic-box">
            <div>weird…what happened?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="liz-box">
            <div>my aunt was concerned</div>
            <div>so she eventually convinced justines mom to let her live with us</div>
        </div>

        <div class="vic-box">
            <div>ahh i see</div>
            <div>wow</div>
            <div>so how is she?</div>

            <div>like now :'( haha</div>
        </div>

        <div class="liz-box">
            <div>yea shes so sweet :)</div>
            <div>i remember when my aunt passed</div>
            <div>everyone was too sad to notice that justine was sick</div>
            <div>but she went to the funeral with the most anxious affection</div>
            <div>she loved my aunt so much</div>
        </div>

        <div class="vic-box">
